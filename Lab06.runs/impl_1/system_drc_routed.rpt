PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga_sync_unit/pixel_reg_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1/O, cell vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
rgb_reg_reg[0]
