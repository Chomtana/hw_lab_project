PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net vga_sync_unit/pixel_reg_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1/O, cell vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
